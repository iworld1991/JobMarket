# Create Labels

Depending whether you are using Office 2003, 2007 or 2010, what you see on your screen may be slightly different from the instructions below. The instruction is based on Office 2007.

Before creating labels, your [EmployersMoniker](https://github.com/llorracc/JobMarket/blob/main/Templates/EmployersMoniker.xlsm) file should already be filled according to its instructions.

The template for creating labels for your mass mailing is the [CreateLabels](https://github.com/llorracc/JobMarket/blob/main/Templates/) document in the
[Templates](https://github.com/llorracc/JobMarket/blob/main/Templates/) directory of the [JobMarket](https://github.com/llorracc/JobMarket) repo.

When you open your copy of this document, click "Yes" at the pop-up warning window.

- Then there will be an error message, continue to click "OK" because your target **EmployersMoniker** file is almost surely not in whatever is the default directory. 

- In the resulting  dialog box, replace the default directory at Data Source `C:\Users\dami\Documents\JobMarket\JMInstructionsRevised\EmployersMoniker.xls` with the path to your `EmployersMoniker` spreadsheet. (See figure below.) For example, if I put my `EmployersMoniker` at "F:/JobMarket/`EmployersMoniker`", use this directory.

After replacing the directory, click "OK". `CreateLabels` now should be successfully opened.

In the **Start Mail Merge** group on the **Mailings** tab, click **Start Mail Merge**, and then click **Step by Step Mail Merge Wizard**.<br />

Then, continue clicking **Next Step** until finished.</p></td>

# Create Cover Letters

The template for creating cover letters for your mass mailing is [CreateCoverLetters](https://github.com/llorracc/JobMarket/blob/main/Templates/) document in [Templates](https://github.com/llorracc/JobMarket/blob/main/Templates/)

Follow the same steps as creating labels.
