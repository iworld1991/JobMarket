Subject: JhuJobMarketPublic The Panel Interview with the IMF
Reply-To: JhuJobMarketPublic@googlegroups.com


Hi,

I had the panel interview with the IMF yesterday. Let me explain how
it proceeded.

I went to D.C. one day before the interview, and stayed at Concordia
Hotel, which was privately owned by the IMF.

I went to HQII of the IMF at 8:30 in the morning. There were 6
interviewees including me. They divided us into two groups. The first
group received the panel interview in the morning, and took the
writing skills test as well as the interview by the human resource
division in the afternoon. The second group took the writing skills
test as well as the interview by the human resource division in the
morning, and received the panel interview in the afternoon.

I belonged to the second group. So I took the writing test first. In
the test, we were required to make a summary and critical comments on
one working paper published by the IMF, which you can choose from
three working papers, in 90 minutes. Time was very limited at least
for me. Spell checks and grammar checks were not turned off.

Second, I had the interview by human resource department. They asked
me the following questions.
        Describe the most stressful experience you had.
        Describe your experience of working in a team.
        How do you manage your busy schedule?
        How do you handle unanticipated changes in the deadline for something?
        What motivates you to do your work?

After the interview, the head of the human resource division took the
interviewees to lunch with one young economist, who joined the IMF
last year. The head of the human resource division told us that the
IMF is going to hire 20 economists this year. (By the way, my friend,
who joined the IMF seven years ago, told me that the IMF hired 60
economists in his year!! I wish I was born earlier.)

After lunch, I had the panel interview. As I mentioned before, three
people took the panel interview in the afternoon. So one interviewee
had to wait for two hours until his or her interview. Fortunately, I
did not have to wait maybe because my last name starts with A. In the
panel interview, there were three senior level economists. I faced the
following questions after three or four questions on my job market
paper.

        There are two views on the U.S. current account deficit. Some
people think it accompanies certain risk. But others think it is not a
problem at all. What is your opinion?
        What does the global imbalances mean to the countries which
have current account surplus?
        The IMF has been criticized about advising fiscal retrenchment
to Asian countries. Suppose you are an economist at the IMF, how will
you defend the IMF?
        Suppose there is a small country which relies much on oil
production. Oil prices are increasing. What policy will you recommend
to that country?
         India develops its infrastructure withdrawing money from its
foreign reserve. What do you think about this policy?

The interview lasted about 45 minutes.

Hope this helps.


Regards,

Kenji
