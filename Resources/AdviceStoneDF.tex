\section{October-November}
\noindent -Look at websites of job candidates at other schools
\medskip

\noindent -Read every advice document
\medskip

\noindent -Try to mention something personal in cover letters (like
'I would like to live in x b/c y') but don't lie.  I wrote something
like `my fiancee and I would like to live in the Pacific Northwest'
in Oregon State one and that came up numerous times in my interviews
with them (probably wouldn't have gotten first round interview
without it). Details in later paragraphs of cover letter didn't come
up with anyone
\medskip

\section{December-January}
\noindent -Print and take the Cawley advice document (on AEA-JOE
website) with you to AEA meeting, fly-outs
\medskip

\noindent -Bring JOE ads for employers you're interviewing with to
AEA meeting (to refer to specifics of what they're looking for)
\medskip

\noindent -Read up on faculty at places you're interviewing, but
don't spend too much time on this
\medskip

\noindent -Write down your 5-10min research description
\medskip

\noindent -Practice and edit 5-10min research description every day
the week before AEA meeting
\medskip

\noindent -Read every advice document again
\medskip

\section{January+}
\noindent -If you get tough question in seminar say `let's discuss
after seminar' (after thinking about it some and attempting to
answer)
\medskip

\noindent -If audience members start talking to each other in
seminar say `let's discuss after seminar'
\medskip

\noindent -Email thank yous after first rounds aren't necessary but
probably can't hurt
\medskip

\noindent -Email thank yous after fly-outs to chair and a few others
you have something interesting to say to
